Many banks have developed online applications for customers to manage their accounts. Account transactions include withdrawing money, depositing money, or transferring money between accounts. Due to this development, there are countless transactions that the bank has to process each day; therefore, it is impractical to keep physical records of each customer’s banking information. The objective of this project is to develop a database management system that keeps track of customers’ banking information. This includes any checking, savings accounts, existing loans, or credit cards.
